Instructions & Data must be loaded into memory before and after processing.

OS must:
- keep track of memory segments used by which processes
- decide which (parts of) processes + data to move to memory
- reclaim memory when no longer needed




## DMA
**DMA** - allows hardware components to bypass CPU and access memory
- high-speed I/O devices
- **1** interrupt per block, instead of each byte
