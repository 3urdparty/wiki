Characteristics of Structured Data:
- Dimensionality
- Sparsity
- Resolution
- Distribution

Data Objects - represents an entity (instance, tuple)
Attributes
Database: rows -> data object, column -> attribute

Attributes (Dimension/Feature/Variable), can be:
- Nominal - categories
	- Binary - 2 categories/states
		- Symmetrical Binary: both outcomes equally important
		- Asymmetrical Binary: Outcomes not equally important
- Ordinal: has meaningfull order but no magnitude between successive values
- Quantitative:
	- Interval-scaled - no true zero-point
	- Ratio-scaled - inherent zero-point

Discrete: finite or countably infinite set of values
Continuous - has real numbers, represented as floating point
