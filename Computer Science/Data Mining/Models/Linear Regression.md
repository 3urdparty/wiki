Equation for a line $y=mx+b$ that best fits the relationship between the input and the output. It is trained by using a objective function that minimizes error (distance between predictions and actual observations), to tune the model paramaters $m$ and $b$

## Objective Functions
OLS - Ordinary Least Squares
GDO - Gradient Descent Optimization

## Downfalls
Variables that are co-related
Susceptive to noise
