CatBoost is an open-source gradient boosting library used to train large amounts of data using ML. It supports the direct usage of categorical variables. It gives a very high performance in comparison to the other boosting algorithms. It is straightforward to implement and run. It is a model developed by Yandex. It provides support for out-of-the-box descriptive data formats and does not require much training. It gives a good performance with a lesser number of training iterations.
