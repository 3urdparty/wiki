# Writeup
## SLAM Algorithms Archetype
Subproblems to solve in SLAM:
Feature Extraction: Identifying key features
Feature matching: matching identified features between current frame and previous frame
Motion estimation: Estimating camera's motion based on feature matching step
data association: matching features to existing map elements or identifying new elements to be added to map
map managmenet: update map, handling addition of new maps and removing obsolete ones
pose graph optimization : local and global optimizations to refine the estimated poses and map, reducing the accumulated errors
Localization
Mapping
Loop Closing

### Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is the stage of the SLAM pipeline to identify distinctive key features to focus on in the next stage, [[#Feature Matching]] to discern the motion. 

Involves identifying distinctive parts of an image, such as edges, corners, shapes, textures, or patterns, to help with the localization and mapping process. 
Some key feature extraction algorithms:
- ORB -  efficient, robust, and rotation invariant. uses a combination of FAST (Features from accelerated Segment) keypoint detection and BRIEF binary descriptor

FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test): corner detection algorithm designed for high-speed feature detection.
1. examine 16 pixels in a circle around a candidate point
2. A pixel is classified as a corner if there exists a set of continuous pixels in the circle that are all brighter or all darker than the center pixel by some threshold

- Uses a simple pixel intensity comparison test
- Employs a quick rejection strategy for non-corners
- Can terminate the test early once sufficient evidence is found

BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features): Creates a binary string to describe a detected feature

1. Selecting pairs of pixels in the feature's neighborhood
2. Comparing their intensities
3. Assigning 0 or 1 based on which pixel is brighter

- Very fast to compute (just pixel comparisons)
- Efficient to store (binary string)
- Fast to match (using Hamming distance)
- Good recognition performance despite simplicity

SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform):

Invariant to:
- Scale changes
- Rotation
- Translation
- Partial illumination change
- Affine distortion
- Noise

1. Scale-space Extrema Detection:
	1. Creates a scale space by convolving the image with Gaussian filters at different scales
	2. Computes Difference of Gaussians (DoG) between adjacent scales
	3. Locates potential keypoints by finding local extrema in DoG images
2. Keypoint Localization:
	1. Refines keypoint locations using interpolation
	2. Rejects low-contrast points and edges
	3. Ensures stability of detected points
3. Orientation Assignment:
	1. Computes gradient magnitude and direction around each keypoint
	2. Creates histogram of local gradient directions
	3. Assigns one or more orientations based on peak directions
	4. This step provides rotation invariance
4. Keypoint Descriptor Generation:
	1. Takes 16x16 neighborhood around keypoint
	2. Divides into 4x4 subregions
	3. Creates 8-bin orientation histogram for each subregion
	4. Results in 128-dimensional feature vector (4x4x8)
	5. Normalizes vector for illumination invariance

The Improved SIFT algorithm can improve the accuracy and robustness of a SLAM system. 
CNN-based
CNN-based feature-point extraction methods have made progress in feature-point detection and descriptor generation. However, they can be computationally and storage complex. 
Feature extraction is a preprocessing method that transforms raw data into numerical features that can be processed while preserving the original data set. This can yield better results than applying machine learning directly to the raw data. 
SLAM is the foundation of augmented reality (AR), allowing AR devices to perceive the world in three dimensions. 


Workflow:
1. Take Video and split to frames
2. Convert frames to depth maps via:
```bash
heif-convert --with-aux ~/Downloads/test.heic ~/Downloads/test.jpg
